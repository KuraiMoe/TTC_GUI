/// <summary>
/// Fixed random keys for the incremental Zobrist hash of <see cref="GameState"/> (Phase 4). The keys come from a
/// SplitMix64 stream with a constant seed, so hashes are identical in every process and run (deterministic search).
///
/// What the hash covers (the information that decides the value of a position within one search of a fixed root):
/// the card instance on each board cell, the owner of every card instance (board and hands), the type modifier of
/// every card instance, and the side to move. Hand membership is implied by the board (a card is in its hand until
/// it is placed). It deliberately does NOT cover: hand order (D-001), display edges (D-003) and the undo history; they
/// only influence move ordering, never a score (<c>EvaluateState</c> reads owners and effective edges only).
///
/// Hash domain: ONE <see cref="GameState"/> object. Instance indices are reused between states, and card ids, edges,
/// types, rules and <c>can_use</c> (invariants of a state) are not hashed, so equal hashes of two different states
/// say nothing. A table keyed by this hash must therefore also record which state (and which AI side and evaluation
/// mode) it was filled for; <c>FastTranspositionTable</c> does this with a <c>SearchContext</c> (review H4-1).
