/// Zobrist hash, stores a bound type with every score, and replaces entries by depth.
///
/// Layout: two-entry buckets (slots <c>2k</c> and <c>2k+1</c>). A probe looks at both slots of the bucket. A store
/// overwrites the entry with the same key if present, otherwise an empty or stale-generation slot, otherwise the
/// shallower of the two (so deep entries survive and the newest entry always gets a slot). The table never refuses a
/// store. <see cref="NewGeneration"/> empties it in O(1) (a generation byte; the array is cleared only when the byte
/// wraps). Only the full 64-bit key is compared; with the bucket index that is 64 + log2(capacity/2) bits, so a false
/// match needs a collision that is astronomically unlikely at the table sizes in use (see CSHARP_MIGRATION.md).
///
/// Validity context (review H4-1). The key identifies a position only inside one <see cref="Core.GameState"/>, and a
/// stored score is from a fixed AI perspective under one evaluation mode. The table therefore records the
/// <see cref="SearchContext"/> (state object, AI side, evaluation mode) of its current generation, and
/// <see cref="RequireContext"/> refuses reuse under any other context. A new table is unbound: it can only be used
/// after a generation was started with a context. The check happens once per search, never per node.
